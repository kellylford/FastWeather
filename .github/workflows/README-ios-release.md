# iOS App Store Release via GitHub Actions

The [`ios-release.yml`](ios-release.yml) workflow builds and uploads a FastWeather
build to App Store Connect from a GitHub-hosted macOS runner.

**Why this exists:** building on a Mac that's on a **beta macOS** (or with a beta
Xcode/SDK) stamps the binary as "compiled with a beta product," and Apple rejects
those for the public App Store. GitHub's runners are always on released macOS +
released Xcode, so builds from here pass review. (TestFlight accepts beta-stamped
builds, which is why your local TestFlight path still works.)

The workflow even guards against this: it aborts if the runner's selected iOS SDK
or Xcode is a beta seed.

## One-time setup: repo secrets

Add these under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**.

| Secret | What it is | How to get it |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| `ASC_KEY_ID` | App Store Connect API key ID | The `key_id` in your `~/.fastweather-keys/asc.json` |
| `ASC_ISSUER_ID` | ASC API issuer ID | The `issuer_id` in that same `asc.json` |
| `ASC_KEY_P8_BASE64` | The `.p8` API key, base64-encoded | `base64 -i <the AuthKey_<ASC_KEY_ID>.p8> \| pbcopy` |
| `DIST_CERT_P12_BASE64` | "Apple Distribution" cert **+ its private key**, base64-encoded | Export a `.p12` (below), then `base64 -i dist.p12 \| pbcopy` |
| `DIST_CERT_PASSWORD` | The password you set on that `.p12` | Whatever you typed during export |
| `OPENMETEO_API_KEY` | *(optional)* Your paid Open-Meteo key | The value in your local `Secrets.swift`. Omit to ship the free tier. |

### Exporting the distribution `.p12`

Easiest via **Keychain Access** (the private key can't be reliably exported from the CLI):

1. Open **Keychain Access** → **login** keychain → **My Certificates**.
2. Find **"Apple Distribution: Kelly Ford (P887QF74N8)"**. Expand it — it must have a
   private key underneath (the disclosure triangle). If it doesn't, that Mac can't
   export a usable cert; create a new distribution cert in Xcode first.
3. Right-click it → **Export "Apple Distribution…"** → **Personal Information Exchange (.p12)**.
4. Save as `dist.p12`, set a password → that password is `DIST_CERT_PASSWORD`.
5. `base64 -i dist.p12 | pbcopy` → paste as `DIST_CERT_P12_BASE64`.

Then delete `dist.p12` when you're done.

## Running it

1. **Actions** tab → **iOS App Store Release** → **Run workflow**.
2. **Build number**: the next unused build for version 1.5.8. Build 4 is already
   consumed (it was uploaded before Apple rejected it), so use **5** or higher.
3. **Marketing version**: leave blank to keep `1.5.8`.
4. Run. On success the build appears in App Store Connect (Processing for ~5–15 min),
   after which you can submit it for App Store review. The `.ipa` is also saved as a
   run artifact.

## Notes

- Signing is automatic: the ASC API key lets `xcodebuild` create/download the App
  Store provisioning profiles for both the app and the widget; the imported `.p12`
  provides the distribution identity.
- The workflow sets the build/marketing number for that run only — it does **not**
  commit the change back. Bump the numbers in git separately when you want the repo
  default to move.
- **Cost:** free for public repos. For a private repo, macOS runner minutes bill at
  10× — a build is a few minutes, so cents per run.
